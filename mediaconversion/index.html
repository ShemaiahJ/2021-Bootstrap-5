      There are several hostile mobs and 2 bosses (the Ender Dragon and the wither) in the game. This list is sorted by chance of encounter. If caught in a difficult place without a weapon, the player can run away if they are outdoors or tunnel downwards and wait for the mob to despawn before surfacing. A fail-safe is to set the difficulty to Peaceful, which removes all hostile mobs, except for the Ender Dragon, shulkers, vindicators, evokers, hoglins and piglins.<br/>

Overworld mobs<br/>
Zombies<br/>
See also: Zombie<br/>
Zombies are one of the easiest hostile mobs to kill, as they use only melee attacks and burn in sunlight (unless they are wearing helmets, carved pumpkins,â€Œ[Java Edition only] or are in water or the shade), and are easy to land a hit on them in melee combat without taking damage due to their slow speed and predictable movement. Zombies are not fast (except for baby zombies, which sprint, are small and hard to hit), and by themselves are merely a nuisance, especially when mining underground.<br/>
<br/>
As zombies are helpless when unable to reach the player, simply getting out of reach can nullify their threat.<br/>
<br/>
The player can also use a bow to shoot zombies, but may wish to save their arrows for more difficult targets.<br/>
<br/>
One of the best ways to deal with a zombie hoard or baby zombie is to pillar up 2 blocks, so it can't reach you but you can still reach it. Don't do this if more dangerous mobs are around, as they may knock you off the pillar.<br/>
<br/>
If possible, luring them out into sunlight will cause them to burn.<br/>
<br/>
Using weapons with the Smite enchantment can take down many zombies easily as they are undead.<br/>
<br/>
On hard difficulty, zombies can spawn other zombies when players hit them, and will transform into drowned when underwater for a long enough time, and can break down wooden doors. If playing on Hard mode, protecting the house with something like an iron door or fence gate is advisable, as zombies can't break through those.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike other hostile mobs, zombies have a farther detection of 40 blocks. This can be exploited to dispatch them before dealing with a more dangerous threats.<br/>
<br/>
Husks<br/>
See also: Husk<br/>
Spawning exclusively in deserts, husks have the same behavior as zombies but don't burn under sunlight, and will inflict the player the Hunger effect. While marginally more dangerous than normal zombies Husks still don't pose much of a threat and can usually be dealt with like any other zombie<br/>
